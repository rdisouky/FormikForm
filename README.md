# FormikForm
Course Assignment: Javascript code for a form that allows for users to submit and email and password but also outlines errors if an invalid email was inputed or if the incorrect password was entered. 

How to Run:

1-Clone this repository

2-Open FormikFormSubmission.js file

3-Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to add incorrect number of password attempts.
